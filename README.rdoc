=== For Jake ===

- I currently have two _page.html.erb's one for the admin and one for the public facing. Any solutions?

=== Ruby modules ===
- Move create into model!

module Foo
	def hello
	  puts 'hello'
	end
end

class Bar
  include Foo
end

class Baz
  include Foo
end

Bar.new.hello => 'hello'
